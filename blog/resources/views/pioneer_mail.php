<p>Dear <?php echo $details ?>,</p>
                
                
                <p>Welcome to Startups Club and the Pioneer family!</p>
            
                <p>Thank you for signing up and becoming a part of our Pioneer Community. The Pioneer community was created as a means of connecting like-minded entrepreneurs. The purpose of a community is to make it possible for members to be able to depend on it for learning, sharing and supporting. We are pushing to make this a global platform for entrepreneurs so that there need not be any city in the world where you are a stranger.</p>

<p>Please take the time to explore the site and get to know the other members. We have many features built into the site to make it possible for you to discover other Pioneers. We will continue to add several more in the weeks and months to come.</p>

<p>We hope your experience with us is enriching!</p>


               
                <p>Warm Regards,</p>
                <p>Team Startups Club</p>
